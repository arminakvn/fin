				<p>In the city of Boston, the nightlife is not as prominent as it is in other cities but in contrast to other cities Boston has the potential and the student base to benefit from a more lively nightlife. This project is intended to present various transit options that run later in the evening in order to promote a more active nightlife keeping in mind the safety and interest of the people who reside in the Boston area.
				How we plan on measuring this information (the interest of Boston locals) is with the data from the MBTA website which gives you in detail who uses the lines, when they are used more frequently, and which lines and stations have more traffic. The information drawn from this will allow us to have a better idea of to who and what the city could potentially cater to. <br> The city could potentially reach a level of profit rivaling that of other large cities that have a thriving night scene along with certain measures implemented to promote these conducts, such as transportation or business premises that are open at night and do most of their business after nightfall, particularly in the early hours of the morning (e.g. 1-3 AM)
				while some areas in the city may be strictly residential.

					For this project, our group decided to focus on data retrieved from the MBTA website detailing the frequency of usage for the different lines. We also found the data for liquor licenses around the city on https://data.boston.gov/dataset/liquor-licenses
					Show how the social infrastructure is lacking and could be improved
					The intro visualization will show how the city can benefit from expanding their nighttime options as compared to other cities.<br>
					For nightlife to work you need venues willing to stay open up until 1-2 am
					Furthermore, transit needs to extend its hours to accommodate for these venues. It is important because some people will specifically go out to get inebriated and without accessible transportation at these hours, they’d be putting themselves in danger.
					Problem: things don’t stay open late and there is limited access to transit 
					Traffic for social activities 
					Anything out of work will show the geographical data: which will show how much traffic different venues can hold
					Initiatives to support a 24hr city 
					Create a narrative where we can say being a 24hr has its perks, and solidify the statement by showing what other cities do.
